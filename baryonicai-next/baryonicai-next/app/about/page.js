      <p>
        Hi, I’m Preeti Kumari — a Senior Software Engineer with over 4 years of hands-on experience across enterprise IT,
        retail systems, and automation. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Georgia and am
        currently based in Atlanta, GA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I embarked my professional journey in 2019 after completing my bachelor's with one of the top consulting firms, Mphasis,
        where I served as a dedicated Technical Support Engineer. In this role, I gained hands-on experience with ServiceNow,
        managing and resolving tickets, troubleshooting SQL queries using logs, and ensuring customer satisfaction through timely
        communication and resolution within SLA timelines. My strong performance led to a promotion as an Assistant Software
        Engineer, where one of my key accomplishments was automating the weekly reporting process—reducing manual intervention by 75%—and
        training colleagues on GitHub best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I’ve built robust backend systems using Java and Python, streamlined ITSM workflows using ServiceNow, and created
        insightful dashboards with Tableau and Power BI. I've worked on high-impact projects involving POS system integration, handheld
        device upgrades, and automation for daily operations. I’ve also debugged and resolved complex L2/L3 technical issues using tools like
        Datadog and Bugsnag.
      </p>
      <p>
        To advance my career and explore better opportunities, I made a deliberate decision to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science from
        the University of Georgia. During my time at the university, I worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and contributed to projects focused
        on capacity planning, ETL processes with AWS Glue, and data engineering practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        What drives me is the challenge of turning inefficiencies into seamless workflows. In my free time, I build side projects like
        COVID forecasting models and a Book Recommendation system.
